# PFM Simulations

This simulation framework has been used as part of the following two
publications:

 + `Harrison-2015`:
   Harrison et al., 'Large-scale Probabilistic Functional Modes from resting
   state fMRI', NeuroImage, 2015.
   DOI: [10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.01.013](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.01.013)

 + `Bijsterbosch-2018`:
   Bijsterbosch et al., 'The relationship between spatial configuration and
   functional connectivity of brain regions revisited', eLife, 2019.
   DOI: [10.7554/eLife.44890](http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.44890)

The main script is [RunTests.m](RunTests.m).

```shell
module load MATLAB/current  # Requires MATLAB >= R2016b
matlab -nodesktop -nosplash -r RunTests
```
